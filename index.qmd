# About {.unnumbered}

Hi! This is Jinting, a master student from Urban Spatial Science.

About ten years ago, I was a professional table tennis player in a provincial team in China. After I was injured and retired, I started to go to school and went to university through the college entrance examination. After I graduated from university, I worked as an automotive engineer in BYD for about half a year, and now I'm at CASA in London. Life is truly a marvelous journey, filled with anticipation for varied experiences.

Back to my academic background. My undergraduate major is geographical sciences, so I have studied remote sensing course. I also used remote sensing in my undergraduate dissertation - I used random forest to classify land use using remotely sensed data from Hainan Island in Google Earth Engine. Although I have some basic knowledge about remote sensing, I feel that it is not deep enough. Therefore, I would like to learn more in-depth remote sensing knowledge and skills through this module.
